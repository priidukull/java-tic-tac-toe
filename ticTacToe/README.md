# TIC TAC TOE GAME
### What is this? 
A command line tic-tac-toe game which allows for two players (X, O) to play the game.
### Why is this?
1) I wanted to learn a thing or two about creating a java program with good test coverage.

2) I wanted a fresh sample of my coding for my RC application.
### How to run this program?
    mvn clean install
    java -jar target/priidukull-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
